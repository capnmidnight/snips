# Overview
==========
A basic recipe for making wine out of apple juice. The emphasis is on 
alcohol content and a pleasant but complex flavor. This apple wine
is not meant to be carbonated like cider.

# Ingredients
=============
5 gallons unfiltered apple juice
5 lbs belgian candi sugar
1 slap-pack cider/ale/wine yeast
1 gallon pure cranberry juice, no sugar added
8, 12oz jars of frozen apple juice concentrate
33, 750 ml wine bottles (two cases)
33, 9x1 3/4 corks

Dissolve sugar in apple juice. Heat if necessary.
Ferment apple in carboy until yeast gives up, about 2 weeks.
Add cranberry juice and apple juice concentrate after fermenting.

# Notes
=======
* You lose a small amount to yeast trub when bottling, about half a bottle.
* The wine fully attenuated. 5lbs of sugar was not enough.
* The wine was quite dry, and the yeast had an overbearing flavor.
* O.G. read 1.090 at 70F. F.G. was 0.995 at 70F. Alcohol estimated at 12.5% ABV before adding cranberry and concentrate. Final estimate: 10.5% ABV.
* There is no alcohol flavor at all. 
* The cranberry helped to cut the yeast flavor.
* The juice concentrate resweetened the drink well.
* But overall, it's a very simple-flavored drink
* No hangover data as of yet.
