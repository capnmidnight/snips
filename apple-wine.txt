# Overview
==========
A basic recipe for making wine out of apple juice. The emphasis is on 
alcohol content and a pleasant but complex flavor. This apple wine
is not meant to be carbonated like cider.

# Ingredients
=============
5 gallons unfiltered apple juice
1 pack champagne yeast
24, 750 ml wine bottles (two cases)

Ferment in carboy until yeast gives up, about 1.5 weeks.

# Notes
=======
* You lose a small amount to yeast trub when bottling.
* Apple juice on its own doesn't have a lot of sugar. This attenuated completely, was very dry and not very alcoholic
* Alcohol estimated at 4.5%
