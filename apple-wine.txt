10 lbs Zulka Morena pure cain sugar
1 pack champagne yeast
1 gallon pure cranberry juice, no sugar added
32, 750 ml wine bottles (two cases)
32, 8x1 3/4 corks

Start yeast starter with 2 cups apple juice and yeast.
Dissolve sugar in apple juice over heat.

# Notes
=======
* Must hit 120F, cooled to 100F while siphoning through ice bath in sink.
* O.G.: 1.118 @ 72 F
* F.G.: 
* You lose a small amount to yeast trub when bottling, about half a bottle.
* The yeast gave up before the must fully attenuated. 10lbs of sugar was more than enough.
* The wine was very sweet, though not as bad as before, and very alcoholic.
* There was also a hot flavor, acetyls due to yeast stress.
* The cranberry once again cut the sweetness of the beverage.
* Caused moderate hangovers.
