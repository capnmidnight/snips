# Overview
==========
A basic recipe for making wine out of apple juice. The emphasis is on 
alcohol content and a pleasant but complex flavor. This apple wine
is not meant to be carbonated like cider.

# Ingredients
=============
5 gallons unfiltered apple juice
15 lbs brown sugar
3 apples, cored and shredded (but not skinned)
2 pears, cored and shredded
2 plums, cored and shredded
1 cheese cloth bag
1 pack champagne yeast
1 gallon pure cranberry juice, no sugar added
32, 750 ml wine bottles (two cases)
32, 8x1 3/4 corks

Dissolve brown sugar in apple juice. Heat if necessary.
Fill the bag with shredded fruit. 
Ferment apple in plastic bucket with removable lid, with bag hanging in juice, retrievable. 
Daily, open lid and squeeze juice out of fruit. 
Ferment until yeast gives up, about 2 weeks.
Add cranberry juice after fermenting.

# Notes
=======
* You lose a small amount to yeast trub when bottling, about half a bottle.
* The displacement of the fruit pushed some of the juice out of the air lock. It molded in the air lock, but the batch luckily did not spoil.
* The yeast gave up before the must fully attenuated. 15lbs of sugar was more than enough.
* The wine was extremely sweet, still thick like syrup, and very alcoholic.
* There was also a hot flavor, acetyls due to yeast stress.
* The cranberry was not originally planned, but it was necessary to cut the sweetness of the beverage.
* Caused severe hangovers.
