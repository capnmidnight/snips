# Overview
==========
A basic recipe for making wine out of apple juice. The emphasis is on 
alcohol content and a pleasant but complex flavor. This apple wine
is not meant to be carbonated like cider.

# Ingredients
=============
5 gallons unfiltered, unpasteurized apple juice

Leave in bucket from farm, allow to ferment spontaneously. 

# Notes
=======
* Completely spoiled. A terrifying presence in my friends' basement. We all lack the courage to open it, even now, 4 years later.
