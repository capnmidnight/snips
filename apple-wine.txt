# Overview
==========
A basic recipe for making wine out of apple juice. The emphasis is on 
alcohol content and a pleasant but complex flavor. This apple wine
is not meant to be carbonated like cider.

# Ingredients
=============
5 gallons unfiltered apple juice
10 lbs sugar-in-the-raw
1 gallon pure cranberry juice, no sugar added
29, 750 ml wine bottles (two cases)
29, 8x1 3/4 corks

Dissolve sugar in apple juice. Heat if necessary.
Ferment apple in carboy until yeast gives up, about 2 weeks.
Add cranberry juice after fermenting.

# Notes
=======
* You lose a small amount to yeast trub when bottling, about half a bottle.
* The yeast gave up before the must fully attenuated. 10lbs of sugar was more than enough.
* The wine was very sweet, though not as bad as before, and very alcoholic.
* There was also a hot flavor, acetyls due to yeast stress.
* The cranberry once again cut the sweetness of the beverage.
* Caused moderate hangovers.
