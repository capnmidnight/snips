A basic recipe for making wine out of apple juice. The emphasis is on 
alcohol content and a pleasant but complex flavor. This apple wine
is not meant to be carbonated like cider.

# Notes
=======
* You lose a small amount to yeast trub when bottling, about a bottle.
* The wine was slightly sweet, with very little yeast flavor. 10 lbs demerara was good.
* The pectic enzyme made it extremely clear. I've never had a clearer batch, even when using finings.
* O.G. read 1.114 at 77F. F.G. was 1.002 at 70F. Alcohol estimated at 16.1% ABV before adding pomegranate. Final estimate: 13.4% ABV.
* There is no alcohol flavor at all. 
* The pomegrante is not a very strong flavor, but quite sweet on its own. It tends to overpower the apple.
* Overall, it's a very simple-flavored drink
* Two glasses made for a very clear-headed, but quite drunk feeling.
* No hangover data as of yet.
